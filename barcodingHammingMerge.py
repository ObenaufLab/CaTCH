# It would be cleaner to apply the distance limit directly while quantifying the barcodes.
# But for the benefit of keeping fewer barcodes in the dictionary, the distance must then be computed for every read.
# Instead, letting the quantifier tally barcodes at identity level and then measuring distances only for the distinct barcodes, reduces the number fo distances calculated.
# It is still a very slow process.
